# local_library_tutorial

My 3rd time working through this excellent Django Tutorial:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website

I've managed to complete the tutorial both times, but couldn't get the test suites to pass completely.

In this iteration, I am going to separate the models into different apps.
